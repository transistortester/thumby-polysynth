# PSdemo
A small demo of the polysynth audio library. Plays two full songs after an intro, all with multi-channel audio.

Pressing A will skip the current song.

* *First song: The Moon - DuckTales (NES)*
* *Second song: Evergreen - Akumajou Densetsu (Famicom) / Japanese Castlevania 3*

## Usage
This has been added to the [Thumby Arcade](https://arcade.thumby.us/), so it can be added to your thumby with a single click.

Alternatively, you can manually add it to your thumby by creating the folder `/Games/PSdemo/` and adding these files to it.
